# QWERTY-decription
This is a small project I made to test my knowledge and make something cool. The basic idea for this project was that it can be a cool password generator.
How does QWERTY decriptor work? It is quite simple, it is inspired by the QWERTY style keyboard that you are probably using right now. 
Basically, you take a key above your wanted key. For example, if you want to type the letter Q, you will type what is above the letter Q, in this case, 1.
All of the sudden, Q becomes 1 , W becomes 2 and so on.
Examples:

QWERTY ==> 123456

PYTHON ==> 065Y9H

Let's break down the "PYTHON" example, look at your keyboard.
You want the letter P, so you type the letter above it, that is 0
You want the letter Y, so you type the letter above it, that is 6
You want the letter T, so you type the letter above it, that is 5
You want the letter H, so you type the letter above it, that is Y
You want the letter O, so you type the letter above it, that is 9
You want the letter N, so you type the letter above it, that is H



How can you use this? 
My main idea was that you can use this to create secure passwords without having to write them down or remember them. Using this way of encryption, you can turn regular, and easy words to remember into something that can not be decrypted that easily and is hard to guess.
For example let's say you want to create a password and your name is John Smith.

JohnSmith ==> U9YHWJ85Y

John Smith all of the sudden becomes something that noone can guess, and the best part is, the QWERTY encryption is easy to learn at first glance yourself. 
I would highly value your feedback, also you are free to use this code however you like, just please put credits, it means a lot!
