# QWERTY-decription
This is a decription program I made up myself while dreaming, no I am not joking. It works pretty simple and you can decrypt it yourself if you are using a QWERTY style keyboard yourself. 
It is simple, if you want to type Q for example, you type the key above it. It is that simple. Check it out for yourself!
It is not perfect, at all. I may improve the code a bit and make it run smoother and more easier to read.
